# scrape-immortalwrt

This is the codes that i wipped up for scrapping some legacy files off immortalwrt website, just in case it's removed in the future

Not really stable, but it gets the job done after a few days of scrapping

If someone don't want to go through the ordeal email me at supervinh0000@gmail.com and i'll send you a full copy of scrapped data
